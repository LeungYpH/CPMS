A Course Project for SCU- College of Software Engineering - Database Management 

## introduction
Be bored of implemnting library management system? Try something different! especially the Comp. Bioers!<br>
it's a system for managing the plants in the school, seeming a little boring actually, but so special for the teachers.<br>

## where you can update
1. different kinds of users entered different UI
2. take use of the "area" infomation
3. update the Main Window
4. add Machine Learning? Probably unfeasible, but interesting!
